Naming:
ACO-[Gamma, Gamma_1, Gamma_2]-Iterations, Ants/Data Ratio, Patch Size

- Grid Size: Too large and no clusters form. Text recommends 10 times data points
- Num_Ants: More ants makes the clusters slightly tighter, but increase computation time significantly
- Gamma: Too high and won't pickup, too low and cannot drop
- Gamma_1: Too high and ants won't even pickup, so very little clustering.
- Gamma_2: Defines clusters better with higher numbers otherwise they just drop points instantly.
- Patch_Size: Too large the ants have too much information and one big "cluster", or just randomly placing essentially.
